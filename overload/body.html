<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppose I have a generic algorithm that <code>transform</code>s a sequence of values 
by an overloaded function <code>f</code>. I want to write it like this:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
template&lt;typename I&gt;
void apply_f(I first, I last)
{
  transform(first, last, f);
}
</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work if <code>f</code> is overloaded or a template.
That's too bad because is the clearest possible expression of my
intent.</p>

<p>Instead, I need to use a lambda algorithm with a concrete argument in 
order to get the compiler to select an appropriate overload of <code>f</code>.</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
template&lt;typename I&gt;
void apply_f(I first, I last)
{
  transform(first, last, [](auto const&amp; x) { return f(x); }
}
</code></p>

<p>This works, but it's not as clear and concise as it could be.
I would much prefer to write the former.</p>

<p>This paper proposes the use of overload sets as function arguments
and variable initializers. In addition to the use of functions above,
we would also like to use <em>operator-id</em>s as well. For example, I want
to call <code>sort</code> like this:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
sort(first, last, operator&gt;);
</code></p>

<p>And I should be able to define function objects using the same
technique:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
auto gt = operator&gt;;
</code></p>

<p>This feature can be provided without introducing any runtime overhead.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The mechanism that makes this language feature work is to synthesize
a lambda expression whenever an overload set is named. In this example:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
template&lt;typename I&gt;
void apply_f(I first, I last)
{
  transform(first, last, f);
}
</code></p>

<p>The <em>id-expression</em> <code>f</code> (which I assume names an overload set) would 
correspond to the following lambda expression:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
[](auto&amp;&amp; x) -&gt; auto&amp;&amp; { return f(std::forward&lt;decltype(x)&gt;(x)); };
</code></p>

<p>Similarly, the use of <code>operator&gt;</code>, either as an argument or as the
initializer of a variable would correspond to this lambda expression:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
[](auto&amp;&amp; a, auto&amp;&amp; b) -&gt;auto&amp;&amp; {
  return std::forward&lt;decltype(a)&gt;(b) &gt; std::forward&lt;decltype(b)&gt;(b);
};
</code></p>

<p>Note that this transformation described below doesn't work for unary 
operators. We would need a mechanism to select between a unary and binary 
operator when the lambda is instantiated. For such operators, we could 
synthesize a polymorphic lambda closure:</p>

<p>``` {.cpp}
struct polymprhic_lambda
{
  template<typename T>
  T&amp;&amp; operator()(T&amp;&amp; x) { return op std::forward<T>(x); }</p>

<p>template<typename T, typename U>
  T&amp;&amp; operator()(T&amp;&amp; a, U&amp;&amp; b) { 
    return std::forward<T>(a) op std:forward<T>(b); 
  }
}
```</p>

<p>This could be compiler magic: an internal "forwarding operator" that
selects its appropriate arity when instantiated and not otherwise.</p>

<p>Note that we could also expand this discussion to include fold expressions.
That is, if a binary operator lambda is called with more than 2 arguments,
we could generate this;</p>

<pre><code>(arg1 op ... op args)
</code></pre>

<p>where arg1 is the first in the sequence and args are the rest. Again, this
requires some compiler magic where the actual formation of the operator
is delayed until instantiation.</p>

<h2>Proposed wording</h2>

<h3>14.8.2.1 Deducing template arguments from a function call  [temp.deduct.call]</h3>

<p>Add the following paragraphs. The only context where the synthesis of generic 
lambdas from an <em>id-expression</em> should be allowed is when the type of the
corresponding parameter is a type template parameter. Note that this context
should be separate from contexts where overload resolution is performed
to take the address of an overloaded function (as those require a target
function type).</p>

<p>If <code>P</code> has type <code>T</code> where <code>T</code> is a type template parameter and <code>A</code> is an 
<em>id-expression</em> that names a set of overloaded functions, then a new lambda 
expression is derived from <code>A</code> as follows.</p>

<p>In general, a generic lambda is formed from an <em>id-expression</em> <code>E</code> as:</p>

<p><code>{.cpp}
[](auto&amp;&amp; args) { return E(std::forward&lt;decltype(args)&gt;(args)...); }
</code></p>

<p>However, if <code>E</code> is an <em>operator-id</em>, of the form <code>operator @</code>, the lambda 
expression depends on the operator:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <em>operator-id</em> is <code>()</code>, the lambda is formed as:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    [](auto&& a, auto...&& args) { return std::forward<decltype(a)>(a)(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...); }
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Otherwise, if the operator is one of <code>[]</code>, the lambda is formed as:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    [](auto&& a, auto&& b) { return std::forward<decltype(a)>(a)[std::forward<decltype(b)>(b)]; }
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Otherwise, the lambda is formed as:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    [](auto&& a, auto&& b) { return std::forward<decltype(a)>(a) @ std::forward<decltype(b)>(b); }
</pre>

<p>The resulting lambda expression is used in place of <code>A</code> for type deduction.</p>

<h2>Implementation experience</h2>

<p>I started an implementation of this feature in GCC last year, but didn't
finish it --- not even close. Effectively, the implementation is capable
of recognizing when to synthesize the lambda expression from an
<em>id-expression</em>, but not actually doing it.</p>

<p>One of the reasons the implementation stalled was the reliance on a library
function in the definition of the lambda expression.</p>

<h2>Related work</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3617.htm">N3617</a>
describes "lifting expressions", which satisfy many of the same aims of
this proposal. However, it requires the <em>lambda-introducer</em> before the
<em>id-expression</em>. This extra annotation seems unnecessary to me.</p>

<p>N3617 goes further and suggests that we allow projection functions like
this:</p>

<pre><code>struct user{
  int id;
  std::string name;
};

vector&lt;user&gt; users{ {4, "A"}, {1, "B"}, {3, "C"}, {0, "D"}, {2, "E"} };
sort(users.begin(), users.end(), ordered_by([]id));
</code></pre>

<p>I think that the current trend is that this problem be solved in the library
and not in the language. For example, the <code>sort</code> function could be (easily)
extended to allow the following:</p>

<pre><code>sort(users.begin(), users.end(), &amp;user::id);
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this would have the same effect as example given above, although
it's not clear what <code>ordered_by</code> should actually do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3701.htm">N3701</a>
made brief mention of this feature, more or less in the form that it is
presented here. However, the rules from N3617 for forming lambda expressions
from operators have been adopted here.</p>
